YFinance-stock-history

ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE - To build an algo trading tool


Currently:
-> Extracts NSE stocks from website and exports to company.db
-> Uses goldberg's YFinance py code - ystockquote.py
-> history.py -> Matches stock script name from equity.csv, queries YFinance
-> Writes to history.db

TODO:
1. Use GFinance as for realtime datasource
2. Run multiple instances
3. Use mysql to allow concurrent access
4. Implement algo models and test result with history
